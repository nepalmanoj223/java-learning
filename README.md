🚀 Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository!
This repo is a collection of everything I’m learning and building while mastering Java, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and some random practice projects along the way.

This is not a “perfect code” repo — it’s a learning in public repo.

📌 Purpose of This Repository

The main goals of this repository are:

To build a strong foundation in Java

To practice DSA step-by-step

To create small projects for hands-on experience

To track my progress over time

To have a single place where all my Java work lives

🧠 What You’ll Find Here
1. Core Java

Basics and fundamentals like:

Variables & Data Types

Input/Output

Conditionals & Loops

Methods & Functions

OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

Exception Handling

File Handling

Collections Framework

2. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Implemented mostly in Java:

Data Structures

Arrays

Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

HashMaps & HashSets

Trees & Binary Trees

Heaps

Graphs

Algorithms

Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Merge, Quick, etc.)

Searching (Linear, Binary)

Recursion & Backtracking

Sliding Window

Two Pointers

Greedy Algorithms

Dynamic Programming (coming soon 👀)

3. Random Mini Projects

Small projects to apply what I learn:

Console-based apps

Games

Problem solvers

Utilities & tools

Experiments with logic

These projects are mainly for:

Practicing problem-solving

Writing cleaner code

Understanding how real programs are structured

(Structure may change as I keep learning.)

🛠 Tools & Environment

Language: Java

IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA

JDK: Java 17+

OS: Windows / Linux

📈 Learning Approach

My approach is simple:

Learn a concept

Implement it in Java

Break it

Fix it

Improve it

Repeat

I focus more on:

Understanding > memorizing

Practice > theory

Consistency > motivation

🎯 Long-Term Goals

Master Java fundamentals

Become confident with DSA

Build real-world projects

Prepare for:

Technical interviews

Competitive programming

Backend development

Cybersecurity tools (later)

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repo contains:

Beginner mistakes

Experimental code

Incomplete implementations

And that’s intentional.
This repo is about growth, not perfection.

🤝 Contributions

This is mainly my personal learning space, but:

Suggestions are welcome

Improvements are appreciated

Code reviews are respected

🌱 Final Note

This repository represents my journey from:

“I barely understand loops”
to
“I can solve real problems with code.”

If you’re also learning Java — feel free to explore, clone, and learn along with me.

Happy coding ☕💻
